**Passionate about technology and computing**. I was born and raised in Valencia (Spain). For a brief time I lived in Madrid, where I obtained my PhD in Computer Science under the guidance of [Professor Miguel A. Otaduy](http://mslab.es/otaduy/). 

My love for computer graphics has led me to dedicate my academic and professional career to learn and research topics related to these fields: physics-based animation of deformable objects and fluids, tactile interaction with ultrasonic haptic devices, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning applied to simulation, high-performance parallel computing, real-time rendering techniques, ...

{{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} If you wish, you can download my {{< staticref "uploads/cv-hector-barreiro-cabrera.pdf" "newtab" >}}curriculum vitae{{< /staticref >}} and my {{< staticref "uploads/thesis-hector-barreiro-cabrera.pdf" "newtab" >}}doctoral thesis{{< /staticref >}}. You can also examine a few [publicly available code excerpts](https://github.com/hecbarcab/code-samples)  taken from projects in which I have had a direct involvement.
